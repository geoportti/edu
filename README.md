# Geoportti Education

Repository for Geoportti educational materials targeted for teachers and learners. Work in progress. 

## Adding items to the TODO-list 

In the project, we will use Github Issues to add new items for the project that should be accomplished. To add a new "issue" (i.e. a todo-item), go to
[Issues -tab (above)](https://github.com/geoportti/edu/issues) and add a "New issue". 

When creating a new issue, you should:
1. give it a concise and descriptive title,
2. possibly add more explanation to the issue as a comment,
3. add possible labels and link the issue to the Project called "Geoportti Edu" from the panel on the right:

## Following the progress of the project

You can follow the progress of the project as a Kanban board from the [Projects -tab](https://github.com/geoportti/edu/projects?query=is%3Aopen),
where we have a dedicated project called ["Geoportti Edu"](https://github.com/orgs/geoportti/projects/1).
